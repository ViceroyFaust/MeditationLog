# TODO
- Begin working on moving away from raw string processing to using List
	- Write own implementation of either ArrayList or AbstractList in order to achieve a sorted add function
	- Optionally, work on implementing a List and some kind of Sort function
	- Since we're beginning to focus on Lists, we need to make an object to store the journal data in. This object should implement the comparable interface in order to sort it
